# VendingMachine
Simulation of vending automate

The idea of this application is too implement basic function of vending machine.
The purpose of this is to study the C# language - and to put this to GitHub for now reason.

Due to task I can only use arrays and if/switch constructions.

So:
1) Machine should apply cash (due coins of 1, 2, 5 or 10) and cards. If cardreader for cards is offline, machine still should be able to work.
2)Customer can and should recive exssesive money back if cash was used and entered summ is bigger than price of bought goods. Cash can be returned with coins of 1, 2, 5 or 10.
3)There can be different ways to return buyed good to customer. However, as we emulate mechanical element it has 3% chance to break - so that customer doesnt resive goods. So we MUST check that customer recived goods - and return money return money if customer didn't recive anything.   
4)Storages in the machine can be differn't either.
